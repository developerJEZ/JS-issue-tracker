# JS-issue-tracker
Created an issue tracker using HTML and JavaScript. This was also my first time using bootstrap, JQuery, and small js libraries.
<h1> This issue tracker allowed me to become familiar with various tools and how they all work together. I worked with localStorage and made a fully interactive issue tracker. I was able to create functions that work and effectively improve the program. </h1>
