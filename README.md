# JS-issue-tracker
Created an issue tracker using HTML and JavaScript. This was also my first time using bootstrap, JQuery, and small js libraries.
<h1> This issue tracker allowed me to become familiar with various tools and how they all work together. I worked with localStorage and made a fully interactive issue tracker. I was able to create functions that work and effectively improve the program. </h1>
</br> </br> </br>
<h3> The user is able to submit an issue using a description, severity level, and responsibility input. </br>
The newly created issue is then displayed below the form, in list form with the other issues. </br>
In this issue list, the user is also able to set the issue status to closed and delete an issue from the list. </h3>
